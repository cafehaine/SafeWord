# Unmaintained project!

I might take another stab at this, but at the moment I no longer plan on developing this.

# SafeWörd

## What is SafeWörd ?

Safeword is a simple to use, thread-ready logging system for Löve2D. It can
output the logs to the console, or love popups.

If outputing in the console, it can also display colors to show how important a
message is.

## How do I use it ?

Simply copy the "safeword" folder in your Löve2D game's root folder, and then
import it. For more info on how to use it, check out the demo main file that is
included.

## The colors don't work for me!

You're probably using Windows. I cannot do much to help you, sorry. If you want
to use colors you should use a POSIX compliant such as Linux, FreeBSD, or even
MacOS.
